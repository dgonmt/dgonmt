- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dgonmt

- I've been on and off programming for the past couple of years. 
- It was a kind of a struggle to realize that I have this interest, after finishing a major in a totally different field.
- Giving my academic background a go, I realized this thought of doing something much more fulfilling then what I do at the moment,
  won't never let me go. So I took a first step towards a major change in my life. A recalibration of a sort.
- My goal is to, starting in 22.08.22 become a java backend programmer.

- I'm open to all kinds of interactions of mutual benefit.
